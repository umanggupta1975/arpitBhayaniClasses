# 🔄 REST vs SSE vs WebSocket in Java Chat Systems

## ❓ Initial Question

> If this was not WebSocket implementation and a normal REST implementation, then at best we could've received the message and then responded with the same message back to the client from which we received the message as a response but not to other clients because we don't know about them and neither we have any connections established with them?

> If we were to use server sent events, then we would have to connect one client using normal REST and another using server sent events, so that once we sent a message from first client we can show it via response through it and for others using server sent events because we have an established connection with them.

## ✅ 1. REST (Request-Response Model)

> "_If this was not WebSocket and a normal REST implementation..._"

### How It Works
- Client makes a request.
- Server processes it and sends a response.
- Once the response is sent, the connection is **closed**.

### Consequences
- Server does **not remember** who the clients are.
- No persistent connection → no way to push updates to clients.
- You **cannot notify other clients** about events or updates.

### Example Use Case
- REST is good for single request/response operations like creating, reading, updating, or deleting resources.

### ✔️ Correct Insight
> "_We could've received the message and then responded with the same message back to the client from which we received the message as a response..._"

Yes — that's all you can do with REST.

## ✅ 2. Server-Sent Events (SSE - One-way Push)

> "_If we were to use server-sent events, then we would connect one client using normal REST and another using SSE..._"

### How It Works
- Client opens a long-lived HTTP connection using `EventSource`.
- Server **keeps the connection open** and can **push messages anytime**.
- Communication is **one-way**: server → client.

### Sending a Message
- One client could send a message using REST (POST).
- Server:
    - Responds to that sender (REST response).
    - Also pushes the message to **other connected clients** via open SSE channels.

### ✔️ Correct Insight
> "_...because we have an established connection with them._"

Exactly. SSE enables pushing messages to clients with open connections.

## ✅ 3. WebSocket (Two-way Persistent Channel)

> WebSocket is ideal for real-time communication like chat.

### How It Works
- **Persistent, full-duplex** connection.
- Both server and client can send and receive messages.
- Server **tracks connected clients** and can push messages at any time.

### Use Case
- Real-time multi-user chat, collaborative editing, multiplayer games, etc.

### Implementation Detail
Your `ChatHandler.java`:
- Stores `WebSocketSession`s.
- Broadcasts messages to all connected clients.

## ❓ Your Concern:
> _"I’m only able to send message from client to server, not getting any message back"_

### ✅ Here's Why:
If:
- You open **only one tab**, and
- You **send a message** from that tab...

...you won’t see anything new added in the `<ul id="messages">`, because:
- You typed the message and it was sent,
- The server broadcasted it to all connected clients — **including the sender**,
- But if you don’t update the UI on your own message, there's no visible feedback.

### ✅ How to Verify It Works:
1. Open the app in **two browser tabs or windows**
2. Send a message from one tab
3. You should see it appear **in both tabs instantly**

If this works — then your **WebSocket broadcast and bidirectional communication is working as expected** 🎉

## 🔁 Feature Comparison

| Feature             | REST                     | SSE                      | WebSocket                |
|---------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|--------------------------|
| **Persistent?**     | ❌ Stateless              | ✅ Long-lived (one-way)   | ✅ Long-lived (two-way)   |
| **Server Push?**    | ❌ Only as response       | ✅ Yes (server → client)  | ✅ Yes (full-duplex)      |
| **Client Tracking?**| ❌ No                     | ✅ Via Emitters           | ✅ Via Sessions           |
| **Real-time Chat?** | 🚫 Not practical          | ⚠️ Possible (one-way)     | ✅ Best suited            |

---

## ✅ TL;DR

- **REST**: Stateless, request-response only, no real-time.
- **SSE**: One-way server push, good for updates or notifications.
- **WebSocket**: Best for real-time, bi-directional, multi-client communication.

## 🚀 Next Steps You Could Explore

- [ ] Build a hybrid REST + SSE pattern (e.g., REST to send, SSE to receive)
- [ ] Add user identities to each WebSocket session
- [ ] Persist chat messages in a database for chat history
- [ ] Implement private messaging over WebSockets
